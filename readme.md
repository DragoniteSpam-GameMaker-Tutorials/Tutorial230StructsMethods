# Struct Methods - Object-Oriented Programming in GameMaker Studio 2.3

It's time to take structs beyond simple collections of data and give them functions which can be automatically scoped to them - in other words, methods!

If you're a fan of object-oriented languages, you will probably be using methods quite often. You can also use these in GameMaker object Create events.

The new built-in function named "method" is related to this, but it has a more specific purpose which I'll talk about later.
